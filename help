# Basics

## Modal editing
This editor is a modal editor. This means that you edit a document 
in multiple different modes. These three modes are 
"Normal" mode, "Insert" mode, and "Command mode"

### Normal mode
When first starting to edit a document you start in Normal mode. 
This mode is used for navigating aronud the document. At the moment 
only h, j, k, l are supported.

"k" moves the cursor up. "j" moves the cursor down, "h" moves the cursor left,
and "l" moves the cursor right.

You can visualize it like this:
   k  
 h   l
   j  

Try moving the cursor here: X

### Insert mode
Insert mode is used for editing the text in the file
You can press "i" to enter insert mode and "<ESC>" (a raw escape) to exit it.
In insert mode you can edit text the way you are used together with "<BS>" (backspace)

## Command mode
Command mode allows you to do more general things. 
You enter command mode by pressing ":". you can for example execute the command
":w" which will force a write to happen. 

Other handy commands you might use are
- ":q" closes the current buffer
- ":help" opens up this help menu
